It follows the pattern of “A Child’s Prayer” in that one part is sung, then the other, and then they are sung at the same time, all with the same piano accompaniment. The song has a beautiful message about how repenting and forgiving brings us closer to God.","dateAdded":{"$date":"2021-04-25T23:25:40.131Z"},"__v":0,"description":"Vocal  Duet","topics":"Forgiveness, Repentance, Jesus Christ"},

I decided it would be perfect to pair up the Primary song with the hymn. My son, Nathan, who plays cello by ear, threw in a few run ideas for the cello part.

I wanted to have the congregation sing a rest hymn of “Come, Come Ye Saints” for Utah’s Pioneer Day, however, I didn’t want it to feel like a rest hymn, but like a powerful choir performance. I wrote this for two people to sit at the piano, so that it would be easy to sight read each part, but sound broader as it expanded across the keyboard. The cello and violin just felt right for the pioneer theme. The audio file was made completely on an electric piano, but the live performance was so much more powerful!  I loved helping the congregation sing out with heart!","dateAdded":{"$date":"2021-04-25T23:56:34.102Z"},"description":"Congregational,  four hand piano, Instrumental Obbligato, cello, violin","topics":"Pioneers, Courage, Grace, Joy","__v":0}
